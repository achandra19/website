        <h4 class="poem-text">
        I look into a lake<br>
        Reflecting a vision of something so great<br>
        Yet who am I looking upon<br>
        Except for my own self and my fate<br>
        </h4>
        <br><br>
        <h4 class="poem-text">
        I'm capable of everything<br>
        Since my self-love soars<br>
        So I don't need anyone else<br>
        I'll write my own lore<br>
        </h4>
        <br><br>
        <h4 class="poem-text">
        As my love burns brighter<br>
        I start to realize<br>
        What purpose does it all serve<br>
        If entropy indeed is not the prize<br>
        </h4>
        <br><br>
        <h4 class="poem-text">
        Scales of judgment work<br>
        Like the clockworks eternal<br>
        Creating a balance between people<br>
        Doesn't that seem deceptional?<br>
        </h4>
        <br><br>
        <h4 class="poem-text">
        After what seems like years<br>
        I learn it is truly a spectrum<br>
        Narcissism possessed by all<br>
        Especially in this age in which we march to society's drum<br>
        </h4>
        <br><br>
        <h4 class="poem-text">
        How can you allow just anyone<br>
        To share in this warmth of love<br>
        You'd be left frozen by your own choices<br>
        But I suppose if I had met someone near a dove<br>
        </h4>
        <br><br>
        <h4 class="poem-text">
        Would she really accept me for who I am?<br>
        But that would be preposterous<br>
        Does this imply I don't love myself?<br>
        Perhaps the fire inside did not make me prosperous<br>
        </h4>
        <br><br>
        <h4 class="poem-text">
        So I contemplate and come to a conclusion<br>
        </h4>
        <br><br>
        <h4 class="poem-text">
        Through loss comes gain<br>
        Emotions intertwined like holy root<br>
        Entropic triumph over zero<br>
        Scales of narcissism on mute<br>
        </h4>
        <br><br>
