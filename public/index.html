     <h2>World Timeline Project</h2>
     <p>In an effort to understand the scope of humanity and life within this planet spanning billions of years, I've decided to map out historically important and interesting points in a world timeline.
     <br>
     My fascination with humanity extends to a mutual interest in philosophy, psychology, literature, and politics. My preliminary goals with this project was to map out human evolution and de-evolution throughout the ages through a timeline of Human-based events. However, my interests extend to human consciousness and psychology, which is shared by all organisms.
     <br> 
     So, the goal of this project now is to map out the history of our living Earth which will depict the story of Humanity as well.
