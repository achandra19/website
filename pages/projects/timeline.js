                    As humans, we all carry within us a blueprint of similar conscious behavior, however, there are experiences
                    that lead us into different "categories" of humanity. 
                    <br></br><br></br>
                    From the year 10000 BCE to now, the intermingling of cultures and different conscious behavior shaped the 
                    unique nature of this globe. We as humans have all evolved together, but in different ways. 
                    <br></br><br></br>
                    The purpose of this project as a whole is to remind people that our timeline is a shared one, and in no 
                    way are we separated and classified any differently than human.

                <h4>Technology Breakdown:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>MongoDB / PlanetScale: Using a database such as MongoDB would provide easy access to different "documents",
                        or historical event entries. 
                        <ul>
                        <li>Use API key with Python/JS to create functionality (GET, SET, POST, etc..)</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <br></br>
                    <li>Three.js / Anime JS: Rendering the events in a 3D space would be visually appealing, as well as providing
                        movement functionality for easier access to eras in history. 
                    </li>
                </ul>
